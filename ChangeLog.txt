-- 0.0.5 Release --
    - Add parameters to the display string for task/function content assist

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.4 Release --

20081202 -- Add brace-matching highlighting to editor
20081213 -- Remove conflict between JDT 'Open Declaration' shortcut and
            SVEditor's shortcut

          - Added a SVEditor build paths and include paths project-properties page


-- TODO --
* Add a build paths and include paths property page
* Add support for including macros using `include and the file provider
* Fix bug in handling of extern tasks/functions
* Support indexing of elements on the build path
* Extended support for 'open declaration'
    * Navigation to class declarations defined on build path
* Add exclusions to Index class: .svn CVS, etc
* Enhance scanner
    - Improve support for macros
        * macros with parameters
        * Change structure of pre-processor and scanner for better pre-processor support
    * Scanner now parses 'extends' portion of class declaration
    * Scanner now parses parameters to class-type fields. Type parameters 
      are also displayed in the outline
* Basic support for content assist
    * Support content assist for `include directives
    * Support content assist for macro invocations
    * Prompt for classes on the build path
    * Prompt for tasks, functions and fields in the current scope (doesn't handle task parameters)
    * Prompt for tasks, functions, and members in the inheritance hierachy
    * Support icons on content-assist (helpful in seeing type and attributes of a suggestion)
* Ensure proper merging of current/new project settings
* Field-attribute icons on outline now update properly when the attributes
  change (ie protected -> local)
* Fix problems with line-number accuracy and macro substitution
    * Better, but still off-by-one occasionally
* Enhance 'open declaration' to use the index to traverse the class 
  hierarchy and find tasks, functions, fields

-- 0.0.3 Release --

20081101 - 
    - Add dedicated C-style comment detector for multi-line comments. Fixes
      cases where the Eclipse built-in multi-line pattern detector failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Future --

- Content Assist
    - Prompt for macro parameters
    - Prompt for class template parameters
    - Parse chained expressions (foo().a.b)
        - Live scan of file doesn't seem to be up-to-date when used for content assist
          
    - Use template parameters of super classes to provide better proposals
    - Support task/function variables
    - 
- SVDB Data Flow Changes
    - SVEditor must be responsible for updating the 'live' copy of the SVDBFile
        - On document change, the data is scanned and merged to the SVDBFile the SVEditor caches
        - Users of this SVDBFile must register listeners on the SVEditor
        - Not clear that we actually must ensure that the Explorer view is the same as the Outline view

- SVDB Changes
    - Want to represent parameterized class instances as unique types. We can always back-reference
      the template class (could be helpful).
- Scanner Improvements
    * Add support for scanning variable declarations within task/function scopes
    - Need a better strategy for detecting that we've left a scope during editing
        - The problem comes up when we miss info defined later in the file because of current user edits
        - Perhaps we can leverage the last-known-good data-structure and lines-modified information to determine
          what portions of the file leave un-touched (with the exception, perhaps, of updating line info)
    - Extend language coverage
    - Better exclusions for behavioral code inside behavioral scopes
- Need to create data files for the base SystemVerilog library, so we can prompt the users for built-in methods
- Add auto-indent rules centered around begin/end and brackets
- Add inheritance hierarchy viewer
- Notification on build-path change. Ensure setting a new build path results in re-scanning
- Need a better strategy for cross-editor navigation. We loose our build-path 
  context when we switch to an editor for a file on the build path
- Investigate mismatch between macro def and invocation parameter counts
- Support folding of begin/end regions
