== Introduction ==
SVEditor supports [http://www.naturaldocs.org/ Natural Docs] style commenting of code.  What does this give me?
* A commenting style that is reasonably easy to sell to your peers
* Provides pop-ups as you mouse over code
** Mousing over a module, variable or function name will automatically bring up the text that the user added as he documented his code
* Allows you to create a reference guide for the verification collateral that you have created.  
** No more maintaining a separate word document that describes your class structure
** Keep your code accurately documented, hit "Generate", Select the packages you want to generated documentation for and Viola

==First Example==
 /**
   * Module: my_module
   * 
   * This is my module.  Paste this code into SVE.  If you mouse over the various items in the
   *  code below, you'll see a pop-up showing these comments
   * 
   */
 module my_module();
    // Variable: first_variable
    // This is the first variable - note using // instead of /*
    logic first_variable;
    
    /**
     * Function: addme
     * 
     * This function adds <second_var> to <first_var>.  Items in angle braces will be 
     * interpreted as links if link exists
     * 
     * Parameters:
     * second_var - logic - default 0 - Minuend
     * first_var  - logic - default 0 - Subtrahend
     * 
     * Returns:
     * logic - sum of second_var and first_var
