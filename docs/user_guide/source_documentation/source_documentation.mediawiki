== Introduction ==
SVEditor supports [http://www.naturaldocs.org/ Natural Docs] style commenting of code.  What does this give me?
* A commenting style that is reasonably easy to sell to your peers
* Provides pop-ups as you mouse over code
** Mousing over a module, variable or function name will automatically bring up the text that the user added as he documented his code
* Allows you to create a reference guide for the verification collateral that you have created.  
** No more maintaining a separate word document that describes your class structure
** Keep your code accurately documented, hit "Generate", Select the packages you want to generated documentation for and Viola

 package another_pkg;
   
   // class: another_pkg_class

   // This is another_pkg_class. And it is simple.

== Generating Documentation ==

First step is to make sure the code is complete.  The documentation generator extracts comments not right at generation, but when the SV Index is built.  Force a rebuild by ''Right-Click on Project in Project Explorer>Rebuild SV Index''.

Next step start the document generator by clicking on the blue "Generate Docs" icon on the toolbar.
